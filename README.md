## Background

This project was really interesting as I frequent tech blogs. In addition, I was also very curious about how to go about handling multiple users and user registration on a site.

## Learnings

Throughout this project I learned a lot more about CRUD operations and DOM manipulation.

## Challenges

Sending information from the DOM to the database was one of the most challenging things for me. Another chanllege was polling the correct information into the handlebars file.

## Usage

Follow the above Heroku link to the fully deployed application. Once on the app, the user can freely navigate between the homepage, individual bog post pages, the login page or the dashboard page.

## Credits

Thank you to Columbia's Full-Stack Web Developer bootcamp for all the assistance and for teaching me all that I have learned.
